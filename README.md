# webserv

webserv is a C++ practice project inspired by the popular web server software, Nginx. It aims to provide hands-on experience with IP system calls, TCP sockets, and teamwork management. The project focuses on understanding HTTP requests, serving static files, executing CGI apps, and designing a configurable application.

## Features

- IP system calls: Gain practical knowledge of IP system calls for network programming.
- TCP sockets: Learn how to create and use TCP sockets for establishing network connections.
- Teamwork management: Complete the project in pairs to promote collaboration and effective teamwork.
- RFC compliant HTTP1.1 server: Implement an HTTP1.1 server that adheres to RFC standards, handling HTTP requests, serving static files, and executing CGI.
- Configuration file control: Design an application that can be easily customized and controlled through configuration files.


## Usage

Once the server is running, access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (or the specified port). The server will respond to HTTP requests, serve static files, and execute CGI scripts based on configuration.
